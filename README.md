This is a piece that examines human-machine-machine interaction. A common trend we see in today's technology-driven society is that computers are generating more and more information, data, and commands solely for other computers to interpret. We are often swamped by this information, and we choose to ignore it. But what happens when we decide to step in and intervene?

Here, the computer uses Processing to manipulate and act on a representation of the same Processing code it is running. What the computer chooses to do is not deterministic. However, any participant can play a role in disturbing and modifying this machine-driven environment. Using a Kinect and audio processing, I enable users to take control when they see fit.
